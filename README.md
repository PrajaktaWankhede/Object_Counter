# Object_Counter
Built an object detection and counting system using YOLOv3, OpenCV, and Streamlit, enabling real-time object identification, counting, and visualization with a user-friendly interface.
## Features

- Detects multiple object classes using YOLOv3 pre-trained on the COCO dataset.
- Counts the number of detected objects by class.
- Visualizes detections with bounding boxes and labels.
- User-friendly interface powered by Streamlit.
## Installation
